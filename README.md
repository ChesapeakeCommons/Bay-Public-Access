# Bay-Public-Access
Public access points are places anyone can visit to swim, hike, paddle or simply enjoy the history and natural beauty of the Chesapeake. Providing access to natural areas helps the public build a connection with the rivers, forests and wildlife of the Bay watershed.  The repo contains data on all 1,122 public access sites in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed

#  Summary

Public Access Sites 2011 represents those locations that provide public water access opportunities along the tidal shoreline of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries and along non-tidal waterways of stream order 5 or greater. It represents an update to the Chesapeake Bay Program's public access data base. The 2011 data was collected, in part, to establish a baseline against which the President's Executive Order Strategy Outcome of establishing 300 new sites by 2025 could be tracked.

# Description

There are four categories of public access: boating access, swimming (beach) access, fishing access, and natural area or trail access. The 2011 data relects an update to the 2009 public access data base. The states of Pennsylvania, New York, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia were invited to provide updated data to the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) during December 2010 - June 2011. This data set represents the best available public access data from CBP and states from this time period. The public access baseline was incoporated into the Chesapeake Bay Public Access planning process and made available for public comment in June-July 2011.
